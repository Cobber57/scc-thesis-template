\section*{\centering Publications}
(This is an example taken from Andrew Moore's thesis, adapt this to suit your own thesis.)

\textbf{NOTE: If you have done joint research e.g. whereby you are not the first author and you feel you need to state the contributions you have made in those papers that relate to your thesis then create another section like `Contribution Statements' whereby you state your contributions in those papers that relate to the thesis. See Kelly Widdicks thesis (page 11) for a great example. If you do create a `Contribution Statements' section that you may want to revise the your `Declaration', of which Kelly Widdicks declaration is a good example. Kelly's thesis link \url{https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/143606/1/2019widdicksphd.pdf}. Also for more details on the regulations by the university on declaring contribution statements see point 18 in appendix 2 of \url{https://bit.ly/2Q4H43I}}

\textbf{ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you have any papers under review perhaps speak with your supervisor before adding them here for anonymity reasons.}\vspace{1cm}
